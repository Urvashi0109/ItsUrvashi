When Kubernetes released version 1.35, it wasn't just another version bump for me.

**It was personal.**

I started contributing to Kubernetes from version 1.33. Back then, I was learning the ropes — understanding how one of the world's largest open-source ecosystems operates under the umbrella of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

Fast forward to v1.35, and I had the incredible opportunity to **lead the Release Documentation Team**.

- **Exciting?** Absolutely.
- **Overwhelming?** Without a doubt.

## Stepping Into Leadership (With Equal Parts Excitement & Fear)

Kubernetes is not just a project. It's a **global collaboration** of thousands of contributors across time zones, cultures, and expertise domains.

When I got the opportunity to lead the Release Docs Team, I was thrilled. But I was also asking myself:

- *Am I ready for this responsibility?*
- *Can I do justice to the role?*
- *Will I be able to support the team effectively?*

> Leadership in open source is different. You don't "manage" people. You **earn trust**, **enable collaboration**, and **create clarity**.

And this was my first time leading a team in such a massive ecosystem.

## Leading Shadows: A Learning Experience

As Release Docs Lead for v1.35, I had **five shadows** working alongside me.

For those unfamiliar, shadows are contributors who assist the lead while learning the release process hands-on. It's a beautiful system — **mentorship built directly into execution**.

But onboarding them was one of the biggest challenges.

When people from different parts of the world come together:

- They have **different communication styles**
- **Different technical strengths**
- **Different comfort levels** in open discussions
- And often, they've **never met before**

So my first priority wasn't documentation.

**It was people.**

---

## Building Team Comfort Before Building Documentation

Before diving deep into tasks, I scheduled calls to:

- ✅ Introduce everyone properly
- ✅ Help people share their backgrounds and strengths
- ✅ Create a safe space for questions

Because I strongly believe:

> **A team performs best when people feel safe to speak.**

If contributors are comfortable:

- They **raise blockers early**
- They **suggest improvements**
- They **challenge ideas constructively**

That psychological safety changed everything.

## Structuring the Chaos: The Responsibility Sheet

Kubernetes releases are not linear. There are:

- 🟢 Light periods
- 🔴 Extremely heavy and hectic windows
- 🔄 Tight coordination with multiple SIGs and feature owners

To avoid confusion, I introduced something simple but powerful:

### A Clear Responsibility Sheet

Once everyone was onboarded and comfortable, I created a detailed responsibility tracker that included:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Ownership assignments** | Everyone knows *who* is doing it |
| **Timelines** | Everyone knows *when* it's due |
| **Dependencies** | Everyone knows *what blocks what* |
| **Voluntary ownership** | Everyone *chose* their responsibilities |

The result?

- ✅ Clear accountability
- ✅ No task ambiguity
- ✅ Smooth coordination
- ✅ Fewer last-minute surprises

This single structured step made our release cycle **significantly more efficient**.

## Encouraging Open Blockers (No Matter How Small)

One important lesson I learned:

> **There's no such thing as a "small" blocker.**

I always encouraged the team to drop their blockers in the group chat — **no hesitation**.

Because when someone shares a problem publicly:

- The whole team learns
- Someone else might already have a solution
- Collective intelligence kicks in

It strengthened team morale and improved transparency.

**Open-source thrives on openness — even in struggles.**

---

## Being Open to Ideas

Another key takeaway:

> **When you lead, you don't need to have all the answers.**

Each shadow brought unique perspectives:

- Different **domain experiences**
- Different **tooling approaches**
- Different **thought processes**

Instead of sticking to "how things were done before," I kept myself open to new ideas.

And some of our **smoothest workflows came from shadow suggestions**.

**Leadership isn't about control. It's about creating space for contribution.**

## What v1.35 Taught Me

Leading the Kubernetes v1.35 Release Docs Team taught me:

1. **Structure reduces stress** — Clear plans prevent panic
2. **Early clarity prevents late chaos** — Set expectations upfront
3. **Psychological safety boosts productivity** — People do their best work when they feel safe
4. **Open blockers improve collaboration** — Transparency builds trust
5. **Leadership is about service, not authority** — Enable, don't control

Most importantly, I learned that **I am capable of more responsibility than I initially believed**.

The hesitation I felt at the beginning? It transformed into confidence — not because everything was perfect, but because **the team moved together**.

## What's Next?

My journey with Kubernetes doesn't stop here.

From contributor in **v1.33** to Release Docs Lead in **v1.35**, the growth has been exponential — both technically and personally.

**And this is just the beginning.**

> Open source doesn't just build software. **It builds people.**

*If you're thinking about contributing to Kubernetes or any open-source project — just start. The community is welcoming, the learning is immense, and the growth is real.*
